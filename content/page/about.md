*Please read what I'm [doing now](/now)!.*

Hi. My name is Robert van Bregt. I am born and raised in [Rotterdam][rotterdam]. 
From a young age, I have been fascinated by the opportunities and possibilities that computers can offer us to make our lives easier, better, more beautiful and more fun.

## Private life

Alway curious about [the latest technological developments][tweakers].

[Home automator](/tags/domotics).

Secretly a bit nerdy?

## Professional life

After a study Business Economics & Information Technology at a university of applied sciences, a few years of working in system administration and software development I entered into project management.
At first in the financial services industry, and after that in healthcare.
Nowadays I manage all kinds of difficult, complex projects with ease. But the focus of the work and my heart remains with my "old love" Information Technology.

More information is available in my [CV](/cv) (in Dutch) or in [my LinkedIn profile][linkedin].

## Supported charities


I am particularly fond of the work of [Bits of Freedom][bitsoffreedom]. They fight for our digital freedom. In addition to providing information and education, they mainly try to share their vision with policy makers.

## Disclaimer

Everything I write and publish over here is my own material and in my personal capacity. You will never read my employer's opinions or policies here. If I do use someone else's material, I will always try to get permission in advance and mention the source. If you come across material without a (correct) mention, please [let me know](/contact). I will then change the listing or remove the material immediately.

Very occasionally I will also post links to products and services for which I receive something in return, without any additional cost for you. For example, a very small amount of money if you buy something from Bol.com via this site, or extra storage space or extension of a subscription if I introduce new users to a service. Sometimes you even get some extras yourself. That way you can [support](/support) me a little with keeping this site up and financing my hobbies.

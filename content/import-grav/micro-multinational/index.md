In [Wired Magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20050207103957/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/view.html?pg=2) van 12 juli staat een aardig stukje over micro outsourcing:

> Did you hear the one about the programmer who outsourced his own job? I read about it on Slashdot.org, the “news for nerds” Web site. A pseudonymous poster wrote, “About a year ago I hired a developer in India to do my job. I pay him $12,000 to do the job I get paid $67,000 for. He’s happy to have the work. I’m happy that I only have to work 90 minutes a day, talking code. My employer thinks I’m telecommuting. Now I’m considering getting a second job and doing the same thing.”

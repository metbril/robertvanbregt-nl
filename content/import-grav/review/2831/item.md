Why bother at all? If someone posts a like, reply or retweet **publicly**, he/she cannot prevent from this being sent/copied etc. all over the net. This should already be in the privacy statement of the original service. Just like WordPress does for it’s native comments. I wouldn’t use a fully anonymized plugin. It defeats the purpose of webmention for me, social interaction. An option to enable it would be fine however.
